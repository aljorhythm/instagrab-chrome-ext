This also means privated profiles cannot be accessed
Videos are not supported as of yet
Not intending to put in on chrome store, might be taken down who knows...
Keep this mum...

Steps

1. Open Chrome
2. Open chrome://extensions
3. Check developer mode
4. Download this folder and unzip somewhere
5. In chrome://extensions click load unpacked extension
6. Select the downloaded folder
7. Go to instagram.com/<username>

Notes

- Make sure that in chrome settings -> advanced settings the "always prompt filename for downloads" is unchecked, if not there would be as many prompts as photos there are.
- Photos are downloaded into Downloads/instagrab

ENJOY
